      <h2>
        <b>
          The United States announced on Friday it was revoking the designation
          of Yemen’s Houthi rebels as a terrorist group effective February 16, a
          reversal by the Biden administration which was welcomed by the United
          Nations and humanitarian groups who feared former president Donald
          Trump’s actions would impede aid deliveries to the conflict-torn
          country facing the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.</b
        >
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h2>
        US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called President Joe Biden’s
        decision to rescind the designation “a recognition of the dire
        humanitarian situation in Yemen”. He said the new US administration
        listened to warnings from the United Nations, humanitarian groups,
        bipartisan members of Congress and others “that the designations could
        have a devastating impact on Yemenis’ access to basic commodities like
        food and fuel”.
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h2>
        Yemen imports 90 per cent of its food, nearly all purchased through
        commercial channels, and UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock warned last
        month that the US designation of the Houthis already had companies
        pulling back from dealing with the Yemenis and would likely lead to “a
        large-scale famine on a scale that we have not seen for nearly 40
        years”.
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h2>
        Blinken’s announcement followed a phone conversation on Thursday with UN
        Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, where Yemen was one of the issues
        they discussed. UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric on Friday called the US
        action “extremely positive”. “We hope that helps build momentum for a
        political solution to the conflict in Yemen,” Dujarric said. “I think
        the reversal of the designation, the naming of the [US] special envoy
        [for Yemen], and the clear, clear language from the top of the
        administration, from president Biden himself, expressing his strong
        support for the UN-led mediation process [...] are very, very welcome
        indeed.”

        [...] are very, very welcome indeed.” In 2014, the rebel Houthis overran
        the capital, Sanaa, and much of Yemen’s north, driving the government
        into exile. A US-backed, Saudi-led coalition intervened the following
        year to try and restore the internationally recognised government, but
        years of UN efforts to get both sides to agree to a ceasefire and start
        peace negotiations have not succeeded. The conflict has been disastrous
        for Yemen, the Arab world’s poorest country, killing more than 112,000
        people, creating a humanitarian disaster, and wrecking infrastructure
        from roads and hospitals to water and electricity networks.

        The State Department confirmed last week that Biden was moving to revoke
        the designation, a day after the president announced an end to offensive
        support to Saudi Arabia’s campaign against the Houthis.
